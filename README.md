👋 Hi, I’m @rociomercedes. I'm 26years old and I'm from Argentina 🌟🌎 
I'm currently focusing on building a strong portfolio of projects to showcase to potential employers 🏗️💼 
while also improving my technical and communication skills.
💪📚 Programming is a constantly evolving field, so I'm always learning and updating my skills. 🌱📈

👀 Some things I do, apart from studying and programming, are playing volleyball 🏐 and reading books. 📚

🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA , deepening my knowledge in SQL, and in the near future, I will probably learn React.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate with anyone with whom I can share tips, advice, and learning.
